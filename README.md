# Lynicon Angular example site
This repository contains an example site illustrating integration of
[Lynicon CMS](https://github.com/jamesej/lyniconanc) and Angular 5 using
the template site from Visual Studio 2017.

It demonstrates the tight integration Lynicon CMS now has with Angular
which could be relatively easily extended to any other JS framework,
tying in routing and CMS editing so that you can edit the content
associated with the current SPA url, and have the SPA update to show
your changes in live preview. You can have a mixture of content managed
and unmanaged urls.
